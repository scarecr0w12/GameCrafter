# Profile recovery and diagnostic worked examples

**Last updated:** 2026-10-02

This runbook expands the [operations guide](OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md) with reproducible actions and acceptance checks. It uses Lantern Workshop and an isolated service. The service owns profile settings, Project registrations and encrypted account credentials; Project workspaces retain their own files and records. See the [glossary](GLOSSARY.md) and [coverage inventory](DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE.md) for these boundaries.

## Before a drill

Use the repository's installed dependencies and built contracts, service and client. Run from the repository root in a host-native shell. A changed source file requires a rebuild before the example can verify it. Do not share a profile between concurrent service instances.

```powershell
npm run build -w @gamecrafter/contracts
npm run build -w @gamecrafter/service-client
npm run build -w @gamecrafter/platform-service
node scripts/verify-documentation-recovery.cjs
```

The runner creates a unique `.turbo/documentation-recovery/<timestamp>` directory containing original/restored profiles, a disposable Project, archives and compact reports. It stops only service instances it started. It retains owned files for inspection instead of removing the recovery evidence. Synthetic credential and recovery-secret values are generated in memory and omitted from the report. It does not request a provider, engine or paid service.

The [retained report](examples/lantern-workshop/verification/profile-recovery.json) records the actual checks. Original failures, if a future run fails, remain under that run's directory; a printed earlier report is not acceptance of a later run.

## Inspect an explicitly selected profile

Use the [read-only diagnostic example](examples/service-diagnostics.cjs) against an already running service:

```powershell
node docs/examples/service-diagnostics.cjs --profile 'E:\GameCrafterProfiles\isolated'
node docs/examples/service-diagnostics.cjs --profile 'E:\GameCrafterProfiles\isolated' --project '<registered-project-uuid>'
```

Replace the path and UUID with actual values. The command requires an absolute profile path, derives the service endpoint with the public client path resolver, and authenticates using that profile's token. It does not start the service or guess the user's default profile.

The output contains service version/protocol/PID/profile identity and registered Project IDs/names/paths. With a Project ID it also fetches index counts, pending work, conflict and broken-reference counts, and vector-store kind/reachability. It does not request raw credentials, settings exports, private source text or provider logs. Paths and Project names can still be private; review output before sharing it.

An absent token, stopped endpoint or authentication error is a failed diagnostic, not a healthy empty profile. The command prints an error code/name and exits nonzero. Use the CLI `status` command and confirm the selected environment before retrying. A successful response proves the local service answered; it does not establish provider, editor or archive health.

## Rebuild an index and validate the result

The recovery runner first reconciles the copied Lantern design, appends a unique synthetic phrase, and requests `knowledge/index/rebuild` with `full: true`. The returned value is a task ID, not a completed index. It polls that exact task until success, rejecting failure/cancellation and bounding the wait.

The service/client sequence is:

```javascript
const { taskId } = await client.call('knowledge/index/rebuild', {
  projectId,
  full: true,
});
const task = await client.call('task/get', { projectId, taskId });
// Poll to a terminal state with a bounded wait before claiming success.
const result = await client.call('knowledge/search', {
  projectId,
  query: uniquePhrase,
  mode: 'lexical',
  sources: ['docs'],
  limit: 5,
});
```

Verify the source path, quoted phrase and citation against the edited file. The runner requires a hit from `docs/DESIGN.md`; it also inspects `knowledge/index/status` through the diagnostic example. Do not delete canon documents to repair their derived index. Reconcile normal edits first; reserve full rebuild for the diagnosed index problem. Lexical success does not verify embeddings or a remote vector store. [Index implementation](../packages/platform-service/src/knowledge/) owns that distinction.

## Restore and launch a profile

The runner creates a synthetic account without testing its endpoint, sets a platform override and registers a disposable Project. It then creates an encrypted local **profile** archive through `backup/identity/create`, `backup/addDestination` and `backup/run` with `scope: 'profile'`.

1. Poll the specific run with `backup/run/get` until **verified**. A run ID or archive filename alone is insufficient.
2. Inspect the archive with its recovery secret. Require `profile.sqlite` and the original `credentials.key`; service token/lock lifecycle files must not be restored from the archive.
3. Restore to a separate empty profile directory. Preserve the original profile and workspaces.
4. Stop the owning original service, select the restored profile, and start there. The runner supplies explicit resolved paths; a manual operator sets `GAMECRAFTER_PROFILE_DIR` before running the CLI.
5. Fetch the original Project ID and compare its workspace path; fetch the platform override and compare its value. Run the diagnostic command against the restored service.
6. After stopping the restored service, verify the synthetic account credential through the owning credential store and database seam. Do not print the value.

The passing drill demonstrates that the restored service launches and retains registration identity, the Restricted override and decryptable synthetic credentials. It does not move the Project workspace. Its registration still points to the original disposable game location. If that location is absent on a replacement host, separately restore the complete game workspace, then use `project/open` with its new absolute path to register the existing manifest identity there. Inspect the returned ID/path and trust state before running tasks. The unchanged-ID path relocation is source-reviewed here, separately from this drill's preserved-path acceptance; a Project archive restoration can instead allocate a new ID as documented in the operations guide.

This is relocation of a current profile plus its normal startup migrations. It does not certify upgrades from every historical schema, cross-OS relocation, restored provider login validity or installed plugin compatibility. [Profile snapshot code](../packages/platform-service/src/backup/snapshot.ts), [restore service](../packages/platform-service/src/backup/backup-service.ts) and [credential store](../packages/platform-service/src/profile/credential-store.ts) are implementation references.

## Demonstrate the credential recovery limit safely

The final check copies the stopped restored profile into another owned directory and replaces the credential key only in that copy. Reading the preserved ciphertext then fails authenticated decryption. The runner checks that the successfully restored profile's original key remains unchanged.

This is a demonstration of failure, not a recommended repair. A replacement key cannot recover old secrets. Recover a matching complete profile/key backup into a separate destination, or re-enter affected account credentials through the supported UI. Keep recovery secrets independently retrievable and protected. A redacted settings export, regenerated IPC token or preserved account display name does not recover the original credential.

Never perform this key replacement on an active or production profile. The runnable example uses random synthetic values, stopped stores and contained test directories. It calls SQLite only through the repository's [database seam](../packages/platform-service/src/db/database.ts).

## Record acceptance before retiring the original

Retain the run report, exact source/version, archive identity and inspected warnings. Compare representative settings, registration IDs/paths and restored files. Exercise the specific engine/provider/plugin operations that the installation actually needs in disposable targets before treating those separate dependencies as recovered.

The Project backup screenshots in the [workflow gallery](WORKFLOW_SCREENSHOTS.md#local-backup-restoration) remain useful for UI controls, wrong-secret rejection and occupied destinations. They are separate from this service-level profile drill. Installer downgrade/rollback, remote archive restoration and Windows isolated plugin execution retain their open status in the [coverage record](DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE.md).
