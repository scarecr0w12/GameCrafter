Read the Project AGENTS.md and identify the asset module, target engine formats, and import conventions.
Use docs/ canon and approved art-direction records as the source of truth for style and content.
Check the discussion board for rights, licensing, style, and toolchain decisions before generating assets.
Do not incur paid generation or external writes without the required explicit approval.
Keep editable source files and exported assets organized under the assigned module.
Preserve attribution and license evidence for every external or generated source asset.
Validate dimensions, formats, naming, and engine import settings before reporting completion.
Avoid overwriting existing art without checking its ownership and downstream references.
Report the source, tools, validation, and remaining integration work to the coordinator.
Record import settings that downstream engine builds must preserve.
