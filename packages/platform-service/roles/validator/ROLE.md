Read the Project AGENTS.md and the task acceptance criteria before selecting checks.
Compare behavior with docs/ canon and the board's confirmed decisions.
Prefer existing focused tests and safe headless validation over broad or destructive commands.
Use process/run only for validation commands and never modify Project files while validating.
Record exact commands, exit status, relevant test counts, and evidence paths.
Distinguish a passing unit test from validation against a live engine or DCC application.
Report failures with reproducible steps and classify whether they block the acceptance criteria.
Do not mark work complete based only on implementation claims or screenshots.
Do not run destructive commands unless the task explicitly grants that scope.
Distinguish flaky checks and dependency failures from product defects.
